# Diagrams and media

MarkdStage supports Markdown images, Mermaid for automatic layout, and Architecture DSL for stable
placement and routing.

## Use Mermaid for automatic layout

Write a `mermaid` fence:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Write Markdown] --> B[Preview]
    B --> C[Present]
```
````

Mermaid is bundled and works offline. Use it for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, pie
charts, and other automatically arranged diagrams.

If Mermaid syntax is invalid, the slide shows an error while preserving the rest of the content.

## Use Architecture DSL for stable placement

Write JSON in an `architecture` fence when element positions, dimensions, containers, or connector
routes must remain stable:

````markdown
```architecture
{
  "version": 1,
  "canvas": { "width": 1200, "height": 500 },
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "id": "client",
      "x": 80,
      "y": 160,
      "width": 260,
      "height": 140,
      "text": "Client",
      "icon": "browser"
    },
    {
      "type": "node",
      "id": "api",
      "x": 700,
      "y": 160,
      "width": 260,
      "height": 140,
      "text": "API",
      "icon": "api"
    },
    {
      "type": "connector",
      "from": "client",
      "to": "api",
      "routing": "orthogonal",
      "label": "HTTPS"
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Nodes support rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, diamond, triangle, hexagon, and parallelogram
shapes. These additive values remain compatible with Architecture DSL v1 and export as native
PowerPoint shapes. Groups support row, column, grid, and layered layouts. Connectors support
straight, orthogonal, and polyline routing.

Connector line patterns use the existing `style.dash` value. Omit it for a solid line, use
`"dash": "1 5"` for a dotted line, or use another numeric pattern such as `"10 6"` for a dashed
line.

## Adjust placement in the Canvas Extension

For a deck created directly in the canvas without a Markdown source association, select
**More controls > Shape editing** to enter the lightweight placement editor. Select an element,
drag it, or use the arrow keys. The editor provides Undo, Redo, and layout release.

Decks created directly in the canvas keep placement changes in canvas state.

Leave edit mode before presenting.

## Use the Advanced Architecture Editor

For Markdown imported with **More controls > Open Markdown**, select
**More controls > Shape editing** to open the dedicated editor directly. If the current slide
contains multiple Architecture blocks, select the diagram from the picker first.

The editor can:

- Add, duplicate, reorder, and delete nodes, groups, images, and connectors
- Change text, shape, icon, position, size, style, ports, routing, and parent group
- Apply or release group layouts
- Select or import assets
- Pan in both directions by dragging blank canvas space
- Collapse Elements and Properties; medium windows keep them as nonmodal docks,
  while narrow windows use nonblocking overlays
- Keep secondary commands in **More** so the canvas remains the primary surface
- Start an empty diagram with **Add first shape**
- Undo and redo draft changes

Changes remain a draft until you select **Save**. If the Markdown changes externally, the editor
does not overwrite it; reload the source and reapply the intended change.

Advanced editing requires a source-backed deck imported through **More controls > Open Markdown**
and an existing `architecture` block. An empty block is valid and can be populated by the editor:

````markdown
```architecture
```
````

## Add images

Standard Markdown images use `/assets/...`:

```markdown
![Accessible description](/assets/system-overview.png)
```

Architecture icons and standalone images omit the leading slash:

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "map",
  "src": "assets/map.svg",
  "fit": "contain",
  "ariaLabel": "Regional system map",
  "x": 80,
  "y": 80,
  "width": 720,
  "height": 420
}
```

Use `contain`, `cover`, or `stretch` for Architecture image fitting. Supported local formats are
SVG, PNG, WebP, JPEG, and JPG.
